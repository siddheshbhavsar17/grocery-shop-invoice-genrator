Grocery Shop Invoice Generator  This project is a simple Java-based grocery shop invoice generator that automates the process of creating invoices for grocery purchases. It allows users to input product details, such as product ID, name, quantity, and price per unit, and calculates the total price for each item and the overall price for all items.
